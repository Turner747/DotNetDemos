# DemoApp

Nothing special going on here, just a bunch of basic command line 
apps created while learning the C# syntax.

This is not clean of laid out in any specical way. As I work on new 
concepts I add a method then run that method in the main method.

This results in a messy, unorganised class with lots of methods and 
sub-classes. But it means I can add to the code without creating a 
new solution or removing old code.
